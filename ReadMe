Topic:
Implementing Data Quality Checks in a GCP ETL/ELT Pipeline with Great Expectations

Why This Topic Is Interesting:
	1.	Data Quality is Critical: Ensuring data integrity in your pipelines is essential.
	2.	Practical Integration: Great Expectations (GE) is a popular open-source framework that provides a systematic way to test, document, and maintain data quality.
	3.	Composer-Friendly: You can easily integrate GE checks as tasks in your Cloud Composer (Airflow) DAGs to automate data validation.
	4.	Hands-On Demo: Demonstrates how to incorporate a new tool into an existing GCP stack: Python, BigQuery, and potentially Dataproc.

30-Minute Session Breakdown

1. Introduction (5 minutes)
	•	What is Great Expectations?
	•	Quick overview: open-source, Python-based data quality framework.
	•	Key features: “Expectations” (data tests), Data Docs (auto-generated documentation), Checkpoints (bundled validations).
	•	Why Integrate With GCP?
	•	Flexible orchestration using Composer (Airflow).
	•	Large-scale data storage/processing with BigQuery and Dataproc.
	•	Automation potential in a DAG workflow.

2. Live Demo Setup (15 minutes)

A. Prerequisites
	1.	Composer Environment: An existing Composer DAG folder or Git repo.
	2.	BigQuery Table: A sample dataset in BigQuery, e.g., a public dataset like bigquery-public-data.samples.shakespeare or any internal table you already have.
	3.	Python Environment: Great Expectations library installed (locally or in a container you’re using for your DAGs).

pip install great-expectations

B. Project Initialization
	•	On your local machine (or a Cloud Shell instance), initialize a Great Expectations project:

great_expectations init


	•	This creates a great_expectations/ folder with preconfigured structure for storing expectations, validations, and documentation.

C. Create a Sample Expectation Suite
	1.	Connect to your BigQuery data
	•	In great_expectations/great_expectations.yml, configure a BigQuery datasource:

datasources:
  my_bigquery_datasource:
    class_name: Datasource
    execution_engine:
      class_name: SqlAlchemyExecutionEngine
      connection_string: bigquery://<PROJECT_ID>?dataset=<DATASET>
    data_connectors:
      default_runtime_data_connector_name:
        class_name: RuntimeDataConnector
        batch_identifiers: ["default_identifier_name"]


	2.	Define Expectations
	•	For demonstration, create a few basic expectations for a BigQuery table (e.g., ensuring no NULL values in a certain column, checking row counts, or verifying numeric ranges):

from great_expectations.core import ExpectationSuite

# CLI-based: great_expectations suite new 
# or programmatically:
suite = context.create_expectation_suite(
  expectation_suite_name="my_first_suite", overwrite_existing=True
)

batch_request = {
  "datasource_name": "my_bigquery_datasource",
  "data_connector_name": "default_runtime_data_connector_name",
  "data_asset_name": "my_table",
  "runtime_parameters": {
    "query": "SELECT * FROM `<PROJECT_ID>.<DATASET>.<TABLE>` LIMIT 1000"
  },
  "batch_identifiers": {"default_identifier_name": "test_run"},
}

validator = context.get_validator(
  batch_request=batch_request, expectation_suite_name="my_first_suite"
)

validator.expect_column_values_to_not_be_null("some_column")
validator.expect_column_values_to_be_between("numeric_column", min_value=0, max_value=10000)

validator.save_expectation_suite(discard_failed_expectations=False)



D. Run a Validation & Generate Data Docs
	•	Execute a validation run locally:

checkpoint_config = {
    "name": "my_checkpoint",
    "config_version": 1.0,
    "class_name": "SimpleCheckpoint",
    "validation_operator_name": "action_list_operator",
    "batches": [batch_request],
}

checkpoint = context.test_yaml_config(yaml_config=yaml.dump(checkpoint_config))
checkpoint_result = checkpoint.run()
context.build_data_docs()
context.open_data_docs()


	•	This will produce Data Docs, an HTML report showing which expectations passed/failed.

3. Orchestrating in Composer (10 minutes)

A. Composer DAG Basics
	•	In your Composer environment (Airflow), you’ll have a DAG file, e.g., great_expectations_dag.py.

B. Create a Python Operator for Validation
	•	Use the PythonOperator in Airflow to trigger GE validation.
	•	Make sure your Composer environment has Great Expectations installed (via requirements.txt or environment dependencies).

from airflow import DAG
from airflow.operators.python_operator import PythonOperator
from datetime import datetime
import os
import great_expectations as ge

def run_ge_validation():
    # Path to your Great Expectations context within Composer
    context = ge.DataContext(
        context_root_dir="/home/airflow/gcs/data/great_expectations"
    )
    # Load checkpoint or create on the fly
    checkpoint_result = context.run_checkpoint(checkpoint_name="my_checkpoint")
    # Optionally, handle success/failure logic
    if not checkpoint_result["success"]:
        raise ValueError("Data Quality Checks Failed")

default_args = {
    "start_date": datetime(2025, 1, 1),
    "retries": 1,
}

with DAG(
    "great_expectations_demo_dag",
    default_args=default_args,
    schedule_interval="@once",
) as dag:

    ge_validation_task = PythonOperator(
        task_id="ge_validation_task",
        python_callable=run_ge_validation,
    )

C. Observing the Results
	•	Trigger the DAG from Composer’s Airflow UI.
	•	Check logs to see pass/fail results.
	•	Optionally, push Data Docs to GCS and serve them for easy team access.

Key Takeaways
	1.	Automated Data Quality: Great Expectations seamlessly integrates with your GCP environment, letting you run checks on BigQuery data.
	2.	Composer Orchestration: Turn your validation into an automated step in your ETL/ELT pipelines.
	3.	Visibility and Documentation: Data Docs provide immediate feedback on data health and can be shared with stakeholders.

Tips for Presenting
	1.	Keep It Hands-On: Show real code and logs rather than just slides.
	2.	Highlight Real-World Edge Cases: For example, demonstrate how a failing check halts the pipeline or sends a Slack/email alert.
	3.	Encourage Interactive Questions: Ask your team about use cases in their current data flows where data quality is a concern.
	4.	Follow-Up: Provide resources (GE docs, sample code) so teammates can replicate the demo in their own environments.
